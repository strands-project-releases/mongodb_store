ros-jade-mongodb-store (0.1.18-0vivid) vivid; urgency=high

  * Split mongodb_store launch file into two.
    This now provides mongodb_store_inc.launch which assumes that a machine tag has been previously set, and is provided by the machine arg. The original mongodb_store.launch file defines a machine tag then calls the _inc.launch file. This design minimises duplication as far as possible, but is still a bit inelegant. The reason we couldn't do everything with a single file, as discussed in #148 <https://github.com/strands-project/mongodb_store/issues/148>, is we can't test whether an argument has been set in roslaunch so we don't know when to define a machine tag ourselves. The additional boolean flag to dictate this definition was not a nice solution either.
    This supercedes  #148 <https://github.com/strands-project/mongodb_store/issues/148>
  * Trying to find why cpp test fails. It appears to be a local issue with library paths not getting passed properly. SOme mention of this is here https://github.com/mikepurvis/ros-install-osx/issues/12
  * [mongodb_store] add limit argument for query
  * [replicator_node.py] add cancel handler for replication
  * [mongodb_store/message_store.py] suppress infinite error output when shutdown without finding mongodb service
  * Fix: remove auto-generated databases in /tmp after a test has been completed that may e.g. fill up the harddisk of a Jenkins server
  * minor help edit
  * logging messages commented
  * aded support for start and end times of playback

  * use False as default value of param 'mongodb_use_daemon'
  * add option to use already launched mongod
  * Fix exception catch.
  * Silence wait_for_service.
    This adds some more helpful output if the messages store services can't be found, but produces no output if they are found within 5 seconds.

  * Remove dependency on bson > 2.3
    Use old hook/default interface to avoid having to install bson 2.3 from
    pip.
  * Remove dependency on pymongo > 2.3
    In older versions of pymongo, Connection serves the same purpose as
    MongoClient. Updated scripts to use Connection instead of MongoClient.
    This allows the package to work with the existing rosdep definitions for
    python-pymongo (shich use the .deb version).
